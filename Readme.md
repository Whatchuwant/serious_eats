Small project using only HTML & CSS. 

I photoshopped the base photo, resizing it. 
My workflow was to work in layers- base photo, then gradiant color overlay, then text, then icon. Finally, making it responsive with media queries. 

The biggest challenge was the media queries. I inspected serious eats website, found and inserted the breakpoints accordingly. Because I designed the feature as full screen first, I had to hard code the location of each text, the gradient and the icon. It took some time, but was ultimately a great learning experience. 

I tested the responsiveness by uploading it (temporarily) to my website which can be seen at http://www.juliereinken.com/serious_eats/thanks.html
