Small project only using HTML & CSS. 

I photoshopped the base photo, resizing it. 
My workflow was to work in layers- base photo, then gradiant color overlay, then text, then icon. Finally, making it responsive with media queries. 

The biggest challenges were the gradiant feature and the icon. I initially tried to make the icon clickable with a small CSS transition (when hovering, the icon gets smaller). However, with only being allowed to use CSS and not say, JQuery or Javascript, laying the icon on top of two CSS blocks, the CSS for the interactive CSS just didn't work. I therefore made the entire feature the link, as in the given example.
